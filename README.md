# Variational-Autoencoder-Implementation

Autoencoders well suited for unsupervised learning, a method for detecting inherent patterns in a data set. Here I implemented 
two Variational Autoencoder using the MNIST dataset with different optimizers: AdaDelta and Adam. Analyzing the performance of both is 
necessary for the quality of the generated distribution.
